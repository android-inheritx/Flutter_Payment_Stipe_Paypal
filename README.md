# flutter_payment_demo

A project for stripe and paypal payment gateway.

- On checkout screen there are two options; pay with stripe and pay with paypal.
 Below are the steps to follow to test both payments.

1) Stripe payment
- put your stripe publishableKey in "pay_via_new_card.dart" and "existing-cards.dart"
- In network_constants put your DYNAMIC_BASE_URL, means the domain which is setup by backend developer
- You need help of backend developer to setup server side code and payement charge api mentioned in network_constans class.
- Once all things get setup you can check the full flow of stripe payment.

2)Paypal payment
- The whole flow will open in webview so you need to manage that way.
- In PaypalServices class, you need to put clientId and secret of your paypal merchant account.
- Then you can test with sandbox account and check for full flow.
